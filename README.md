# BMG (Belanja Mingguan Gue / My Weekly Groceries)

BMG (Belanja Mingguan Gue) is a web-based application designed to help users manage their weekly grocery shopping more effectively. It aims to provide a simple and focused tool for planning, budgeting, and tracking grocery expenses.

Problem Statement

Many individuals and households still rely on manual notes or memory for grocery shopping, often leading to unplanned purchases, budget overruns, or forgetting essential items. [cite_start]While general finance apps like Money Lover or Monefy exist, they can be overly complex or not specifically tailored for the routine task of weekly grocery management[cite: 1308]. BMG addresses this gap by offering a practical and straightforward solution for systematic grocery planning and expense tracking.
